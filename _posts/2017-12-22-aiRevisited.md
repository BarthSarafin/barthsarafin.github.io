# AI revisited - Are we still a bunch of scared cave men?
Well. Here we are again. After a semester of artificial intelligence lectures, so 14 weeks for all the non-academics who might have accidently landed here, I can consciously say that nothing has changed. We still are a bunch of scared cavemen.
Specifically we as a whole people. Not you, dear reader, or me. We actually are more like the Wright Brothers as referenced in [my first blog post](https://barthsarafin.github.io/AI-Cavemen/ "barthsarafin's cavemen blog"). We see the future, we accept change and look for the new and exciting stuff out there just waiting to be explored.

## The crave for perfection
In some ways we are just like the [the Borg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg_(Star_Trek)). We always want to improve everything.
This is not a bad thing per se, as long as we do not lose our humanity. I think this sounds darker than it actually is.
What I mean is to not lose focus on improving ourselves as well, not only our creations. Of course I want to see a great artificial super intelligence. Of course I would love to work on a project that tries to find those perfect lines of code and algorithms. Nonetheless I also want to live a full life and enjoy the more natural stuff of our surroundings. That is what perfection means for me.

## The strength of algorithms
One of the most important things I realized this half year is how much one can do with the real algorithm.
I mean sure coding is fun and all, but that sweet feeling, when your code compiles and it itself is so brutally short,
that you are certain this should not actually work. But, here comes a recursive algorithm. BAM! It just runs.
That feeling is great and cemented my belief that I made the right decision in choosing this path. It also showed me that I have a craving
for making machines learn. This semester we only really took it to a basic level. Improving decision trees and make rather small
choices. Nonetheless it was very interesting to learn how much can be done with a rather small amount of tools. The people who created the tools made a great job. And as soon as our frameworks provided were running, the workflow was in a constant stream.

## Improving our future

What Elon Musk is saying here almost translates to: If you do not believe in a better future, stay in bed!
Funnily enough, I encountered such a day this semester. And I took his _kind of an advice_ - I stayed in bed. It was worth it.
It gave me the needed insight in what I did wrong with my frustratingly _not_ advancing AI algorithms. I had time to actually think. I did not need to run around and think about other things. To really come a step further, that is what we all need. Just stop! And think!
Papa Elon has again made a quote, probably meant as something completely different, that made me think. In a different way. At the end of said day I not only had the solution to my algorithmic problem, but also the insight in what I wanted to do in the future, what patch I wanted to go from here on. So, Thanks, Elon!

Sometimes we all just need to _Stop! And think!_
