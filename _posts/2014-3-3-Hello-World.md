# AI revisited - Are we still a bunch of scared cave men?
Well. Here we are again. After a semester of artificial intelligence lectures, so 14 weeks for all the non-academics who might have accidently landed here, I can consciously say that nothing has changed. We still are a bunch of scared cavemen.
Specifically we as a whole people. Not you, dear reader, or me. We actually are more like the Wright Brothers as referenced in [my first blog post](https://barthsarafin.github.io/ "barthsarafin's github pages"). We see the future, we accept change and look for the new and exciting stuff out there just waiting to be explored.
